# Nadeshiko

Nadeshiko is a cute little Discord bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage") 3.6.9, using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library. The bot's main purposes are to stream music from Youtube videos and do Wolfram Alpha queries so that online group work can be easy, enjoyable without having to switch between tabs from Discord to Internet browsers to do such stuffs.  

fyi: Nadeshiko is based on a female anime character [Nadeshiko Kagamihara](https://yuru-camp.fandom.com/wiki/Nadeshiko_Kagamihara). She is cute and happy and she can be your perfect studying partner (aka your 2D waifu) ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶.
